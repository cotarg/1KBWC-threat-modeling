# Congenial Carnival Rule Sheet (1kBWC)
Materials:
* Blank Cards — at least 25 per person playing[1]
* Pre-made cards if you have them/want to use them
* Pens/Pencils/Crayons — at least one per person, but if you want to do art, more works
* People who want to threat model a system
* System to threat model

**Summary**:
_1KBWC of Threat Modeling_ is a card game where the cards are designed by the players. It’s a remix of the game _1000 Blank White Cards_ and _Fluxx_. The object of the game is to start with a basic concept of a system, and use creative thinking to find places the system is vulnerable and strategies to repair or mitigate the vulnerabilities. This is a semi-cooperative game, since the goal is to make a system stronger. It can be played by groups of up to 10, although 5 is easier to manage. Less than three, while lovely, is probably not going to be terribly productive, however, due to the nature of the game.

**Prior to play**:
If you’ve played _1KBWC of Threat Modeling_ before, take any pre-made cards you wish to include in your current session, count them, and then bring your deck of cards up to 20 per player by adding blank cards. If you’ve never played before, just put twenty blank cards per player into a stack.

You will also need to maintain a reserve of blank cards, set those aside in a place where they won’t be confused for the “draw” deck, but where folks can find them if they need them. (See [templates](https://github.com/cotarg/congenial-carnival/tree/main/templates) for a few sample table layouts.)

In the original _1000 Blank White Cards_ the game begins with an empty table. In this remix, however, after preparing a deck, you prepare the table for the game by laying cards which have been prepared to model the system you’re threat modeling. Our [examples](https://github.com/cotarg/congenial-carnival/tree/main/examples) folder has a few sample systems to demonstrate what these should look like. The goal is to provide an accurate representation of the system as it currently exists, or is designed.

(If you think of ways the system is vulnerable during this step, do not mitigate them. Make a note for yourself and see if it comes up during the game, or if you can introduce it as a player.)

Give each player 5 blank cards and a pen. Take ten minutes for each player to prepare the cards they want to have in their opening hands. To prepare cards, look at the system laid out on the table and write/draw on the blank cards. What to write? Write a vulnerability you see in the system as represented, or write a security measure related to the system that you think will mitigate a vulnerability you see.

_Preparing Your Cards_:
Before beginning play, look at the system 

**Gameplay**:
_Basic turn order_:
1: Play one card.
2: Do any actions required by the card or cards on the table.
3: Draw one card.

_Playing a Card_: On your turn you will take a card from your hand and lay it on the table. If you are playing a blank card, part of the process of play is writing on your card. If you’re playing a pre-prepared card, you will lay the card on the table in the play area.

_Do any actions required by the previously played cards_: Cards played by other players may contain actions, and if they do, you do those actions as part of your turn.

_Draw one card_: There will also be a deck of cards on the table, and at the end of your turn you take one card from the deck. If there are no cards left, the game ends after everyone has had a final turn.
