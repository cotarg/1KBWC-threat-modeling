# 1000 Blank White Cards of Threat Modeling

_1000 Blank White Cards of Threat Modeling_ is based on [1000 Blank White Cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4550/1000-blank-white-cards), which was the predecessor of the popular game [Fluxx](http://www.fluxxgames.com/#fluxx5). _1kBWC_ starts with a pre-defined "system" (our sample system is the TODO), and then encourages players to Red Team/attack the system by brainstorming and creating "exploits" and Blue Team/defend it by devising patches to those exploits. _1kBWC_ relies on emergent gameplay and player creativity for success...but it also requires a willingness to be comfortable with uncertainty.

## Getting Started

To play using a sample or previous system, simply grab the rulesheet, the templated system you want to play with, and the materials listed on the rulesheet and have fun! To play using a new system, grab the rulesheet and follow the rules as if you've never played before!

### Prerequisites

* A system you want to assess for vulnerabilities (does not need to be technical; social, environmental, and conceptual hacking is still hacking)
* A group of people (3-10 is best) to help you break the system

## Built With

* [Bear Writing App](https://bear.app/) -- most text originally drafted in Bear Writer
